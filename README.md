# IITH_CS3510_Assign1_Dec2020

## What is this?
This program creates a child process. It calculates the time it took for the child process to complete execution.

## Prerequisites
- [GNU Compiler Collection (Linux)](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [A Linux Machine](https://www.debian.org/)

---
## Usage
- Compile using `gcc index.cpp`
- Execute the program using `./a.out <command>` e.g. `./a.out ls`
- Note that ./a.out only accepts one command. i.e. `./a.out ls` works, while `./a.out ls -l` and `./a.out "ls -l"` do not work
